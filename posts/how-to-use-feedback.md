Once you get your feedback, whatâ€™s next?

Hereâ€™s how to actually use it to move your startup forward.

## 1. Read It With an Open Mind

Some feedback may challenge your assumptions. Thatâ€™s a good thing.

## 2. Look for Patterns

Did three validators mention the same risk or confusion? Thatâ€™s a signal.

## 3. Take Action

- Clarify your value proposition
- Adjust your target audience
- Pivot or double down â€” based on the data

Feedback is only valuable if you use it.
