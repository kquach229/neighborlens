title: Validator Profiles Are Live

date: 01-22-25

We're excited to roll out **Validator Profiles**, a new way to understand who's giving you feedback on your idea.

Until now, responses came anonymously. Now, validators can **opt in to share their name, background, and expertise** — giving you richer context behind each review.

## Why It Matters

A review from someone who’s built 5 SaaS apps? That might hit different than feedback from someone brand new to tech.

This feature helps you:

- See who's behind the response
- Build trust in the feedback
- Reach out for follow-up (if they allow it)

## Optional, Always Respectful

Privacy still matters. Validators can choose what (if anything) they want to share.

We’re always listening — if you have suggestions for improving the feedback loop, [let us know](mailto:support@validatelens.com).
