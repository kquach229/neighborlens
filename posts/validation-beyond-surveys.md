Surveys are easy. But they often produce **surface-level answers**.

Here are three alternatives:

#### 1. Run a Concierge MVP

Manually deliver the service before you automate it.

#### 2. Pretend to Have a Product

Put up a landing page, see if people are willing to pay, then decide whether to build.

#### 3. Paid Ads as a Test

Spend $50 on ads to gauge real interest â€” it's cheaper than a full launch.

> **Pro Tip:** Actions > words. Always prioritize what people _do_, not just what they _say_.
