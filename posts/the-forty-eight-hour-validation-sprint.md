Need to validate an idea _fast_? Here’s a two-day plan:

**Day 1**

- Define your core hypothesis.
- Build a super simple landing page.
- Draft 3–4 questions to ask early users.

**Day 2**

- Share your page on relevant forums or communities.
- Collect data on sign-ups, clicks, and responses.
- Make a **go/no-go decision**.

This forces you to focus on essentials — no overthinking, just action.
