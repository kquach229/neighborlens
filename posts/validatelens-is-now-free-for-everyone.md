We have a big announcement: **ValidateLens is now completely free to use ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰**.

Thatâ€™s right â€” submitting your startup idea no longer requires buying credits. Whether youâ€™re just testing the waters or gathering feedback before launch, you can now do it all at no cost.

## A Thank You to Our Early Supporters

First off, a huge thank you to everyone whoâ€™s supported ValidateLens so far. Whether you were an early user, validator, or just someone who shared the project â€” your belief in this tool helped bring it to life.

Your support has been everything. This shift is a way to pay it forward and let more people benefit from quick, honest idea validation.

## Why the Change?

Weâ€™re making this update to remove barriers. Feedback should be accessible to every builder, not just those with a budget. By removing paid credits, we hope to encourage more experimentation and faster iteration for everyone using the platform.

---

## Whatâ€™s Different?

To keep things sustainable, weâ€™ve made a few **minor downgrades** to our hosting and infrastructure:

- The site has moved to **[validatelens.vercel.app](https://validatelens.vercel.app)**
- Some advanced features and backend tooling have been scaled down
- You may notice slight changes in speed or interface polish

But the **core experience remains the same**:

- Submit an idea
- Get real human feedback
- Decide what to build (or not build) next

---

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Weâ€™re still focused on making ValidateLens a tool that helps builders test assumptions and move forward with confidence. Expect future updates that continue to simplify the validation process and make feedback even more actionable.

Thanks again for being part of this journey. And if youâ€™ve been on the fence about submitting â€” thereâ€™s no better time than now.
