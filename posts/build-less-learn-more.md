Many founders confuse **building** with **progress**.

Instead of spending months perfecting a product, try this:

1. Create a one-page landing site describing the value proposition.
2. Drive **just 20–30 people** to it.
3. Measure their **actual behavior**, not just opinions.

> _If no one clicks “Sign Up” on a fake button, will they really use the real product?_

By testing demand early, you avoid wasting time on features no one wants.
