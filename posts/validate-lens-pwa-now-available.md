We’re excited to announce that **ValidateLens is now available as a Progressive Web App (PWA)**! 🎉

This means you can now install ValidateLens on your mobile device or desktop and use it just like a native app — fast, lightweight, and always one tap away.

## 🚀 Why a PWA?

Going PWA means:

- Lightning-fast experience
- Works offline or in flaky network conditions
- Installs directly to your home screen or dock
- No App Store needed

## 📱 How to Install on Mobile

### iOS (Safari):

1. Open [validatelens.vercel.app](https://validatelens.vercel.app) in Safari.
2. Tap the **Share icon** (square with an arrow).
3. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
4. Name the app whatever you'd like (e.g. ValidateLens), then tap **Add**.

You’ll now see the ValidateLens icon on your home screen!

### Android (Chrome):

1. Visit [validatelens.vercel.app](https://validatelens.vercel.app) in Chrome.
2. You should see a banner saying **"Add ValidateLens to Home screen"**. Tap it.
3. If not, tap the **three-dot menu** in the top-right.
4. Select **Install App** or **Add to Home Screen**.
5. Confirm, and you’re done!

## 🖥️ How to Install on Desktop

### Chrome / Edge / Brave:

1. Open [validatelens.vercel.app](https://validatelens.vercel.app).
2. Look for the **Install icon** (usually a computer monitor with a down arrow) in the address bar.
3. Click it, then confirm.
4. ValidateLens will open in its own window and be added to your dock/start menu.

## 💡 Tip: Enable Notifications (Coming Soon)

We’re working on push notifications so you can be alerted when you receive new validator feedback or updates. Stay tuned!
