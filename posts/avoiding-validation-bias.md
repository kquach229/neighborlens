title: Avoiding Bias in Your Validation Process

We all want our idea to succeed. But that optimism can get in the way of good validation.

## 1. Don’t Lead the Witness

Avoid questions like “Don’t you think this is great?” Instead, ask:

> “Would you use something like this? Why or why not?”

## 2. Separate Identity from Idea

It’s not _you_ being judged — it’s just an early concept. Feedback helps it improve.

## 3. Invite Skepticism

Critique is fuel. The best feedback is often the hardest to hear.
