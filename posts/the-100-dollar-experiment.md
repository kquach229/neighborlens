title: The $100 Experiment
date: 05-14-25

Here’s a simple framework for validating an idea on a budget.

**Goal:** Prove whether a real audience _cares_ about your solution.

**Steps:**

1. Create a simple landing page with a clear call-to-action.
2. Run $100 in targeted ads (Meta, LinkedIn, Google).
3. Track click-through rate and sign-ups.

> If your conversion rate is below 5%, either the **messaging** or the **idea** needs work.

This experiment takes less than a week — and can save you months of wasted effort.
