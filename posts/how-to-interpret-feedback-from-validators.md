Getting feedback is one thing. Knowing what to do with it is another.

Here’s how to make the most of the insight you get from ValidateLens.

## 1. Look for Patterns

If 3 out of 4 validators say your problem isn’t compelling — listen.

Patterns in feedback help cut through noise. Don’t fixate on outliers. Find the signal.

## 2. Separate Emotion from Insight

If feedback stings, that’s okay. It means your idea matters to you.

But don’t take it personally. Take it seriously.

## 3. Don’t Expect a Green Light Every Time

The goal isn’t to get all thumbs-up. It’s to learn.

Even negative feedback can help you improve the pitch, narrow the target, or spark a better version of the same idea.

## 4. Ask: “What’s the next test?”

Use feedback as fuel. What can you validate next? Maybe it’s pricing. Maybe it’s demand. Maybe it’s your customer segment.

## Feedback is the First Milestone

It’s not the end — it’s the beginning.
