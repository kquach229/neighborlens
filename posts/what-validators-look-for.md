Curious what validators evaluate when reviewing your startup idea?

Here are the big things theyâ€™re paying attention to:

## 1. The Problem

Is it real? Urgent? Costly? Validators try to gauge how painful it really is.

## 2. The Solution

Is it a creative or practical fit for the problem? Does it stand out from existing options?

## 3. Your Assumptions

Validators often poke at assumptions around user behavior or willingness to pay.

## 4. Business Potential

Theyâ€™ll consider if the idea could scale, monetize, or serve a niche well.
