title: How to Write a Good Idea Pitch for Validation

The better you describe your idea, the more helpful your feedback will be.

At ValidateLens, your idea submission doesn’t have to be perfect — but it should give validators enough to work with.

Here’s how to write a great one.

## 1. Start With the Problem

What pain point are you solving? Be clear and specific.

> "People forget to cancel free trials and get charged without realizing it."

## 2. Show Your Solution

What are you building (or thinking of building) to solve it?

> "An app that tracks free trials and reminds users to cancel before they’re charged."

## 3. Add Some Context

Have you seen others try this? What makes yours different? What inspired you?

## 4. Ask a Question

End your pitch with a question for the validator. Example:

> “Is this a real enough problem that people would actually download an app to solve it?”

## Keep It Short. Keep It Clear.

You don’t need a pitch deck. Just a few honest sentences can go a long way.

The goal is simple: give someone enough to understand your idea — and tell you whether it’s worth building.
