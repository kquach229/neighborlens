title: What Makes a Great Validator Response?

Ever wonder what kind of feedback makes a validator great?

At ValidateLens, we review responses to ensure quality — and here's what we consider top-tier.

## 1. Specificity

Great validators don’t just say “this won’t work.” They explain why.

> "I’m not convinced people would download another app just to track free trials — unless it does something else too."

## 2. Thoughtfulness

Validators who engage deeply with the idea — considering the real-world use case, alternatives, and risks — provide the most value.

## 3. Constructive Tone

Even if the idea isn’t ready, helpful feedback keeps the founder motivated. Good validators critique the _idea_, not the person.

## 4. Clarity

Validators who write clearly and concisely — without jargon or fluff — help you move faster.

## 5. Actionability

The best responses don’t just analyze — they suggest a next step.

> “You might consider narrowing this down to freelancers who manage multiple tools.”

## Bonus: When Validators Ask _You_ Questions

That’s gold. It means they’re engaging deeply and want to help sharpen the idea.
