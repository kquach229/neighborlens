The value of ValidateLens lives in the people giving feedback. And we’ve noticed a few patterns from the best validators on the platform.

They tend to:

✅ Ask follow-up questions  
✅ Share what _they_ would do  
✅ Offer honest, respectful takes  
✅ Highlight blind spots

Want to be a better validator? Think like a builder. Ask yourself:

> “If I were working on this, what would I want to know?”

Your insights don’t need to be perfect. Just honest and constructive.

Thanks to everyone making the platform better with every thoughtful comment.
