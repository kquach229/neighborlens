Curious what happens after you hit “submit” on ValidateLens?

Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at how your idea gets reviewed and returned with helpful insights.

## Step 1: Routing to Validators

Once your submission is received, it’s routed to a pool of experienced validators — operators, entrepreneurs, and product thinkers — who are online and available.

## Step 2: Human Review

Validators read your pitch and think through the following:

- Is this a real problem?
- Does the solution make sense?
- What assumptions are untested?
- Would I personally use this or know someone who would?

They take your pitch seriously — because they’ve been in your shoes.

## Step 3: Feedback Delivered

Within 24 hours, you’ll get thoughtful, concise feedback:

- A rating from 1 to 5
- Specific notes or suggestions
- Optional follow-up questions

And if you submit to multiple validators, you’ll see where opinions align — or differ.

## Step 4: You Decide What’s Next

Armed with this feedback, you can:

- Move forward with confidence
- Tweak your idea
- Park it and revisit later

You’re in control — ValidateLens just gives you clarity.
