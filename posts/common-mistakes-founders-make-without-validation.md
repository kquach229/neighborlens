We get it â€” youâ€™re excited about your idea. Thatâ€™s awesome.

But before you go all-in, here are some of the most common mistakes we see founders make when they skip validation.

## 1. Falling in Love With the Solution

Too often, founders become obsessed with their product â€” without ever checking if anyone actually wants it.

> "Build it and they will come" is a myth.

## 2. Solving Problems That Donâ€™t Exist

Just because _you_ would use it doesnâ€™t mean _others_ will. Validation helps reveal whether the problem is widespread and painful enough to solve.

## 3. Spending Too Much Too Early

From domains to devs, founders often start spending money fast. Without knowing if their idea has legs, that can become a sunk cost trap.

## 4. Ignoring Feedback

Early feedback can feel uncomfortable â€” but itâ€™s gold. The more you embrace it, the stronger your idea becomes.

## Validate Before You Build

At ValidateLens, weâ€™ve seen hundreds of ideas. The best ones arenâ€™t always flashy â€” theyâ€™re just clearly solving a real problem.

You might be one validation away from unlocking your best version of the idea.
