title: What Makes an Idea “Validatable”?

Not every idea needs a full prototype to validate. In fact, most don’t.

Here’s what makes an idea ready for feedback.

## 1. It Solves a Clear Problem

Ideas that tackle a pain point — especially one you've experienced — tend to resonate.

## 2. It’s More Than a Feature

Validators look for concepts with business potential. A feature tweak might not be enough.

## 3. It’s Specific Enough

You don’t need a 10-page doc. Just be clear:

- Who it’s for
- What it solves
- How you plan to deliver it

If you’ve got that, you’re ready.
