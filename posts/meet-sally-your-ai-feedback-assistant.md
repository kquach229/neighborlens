We’re excited to introduce someone new to your validation journey: **AI Sally**, your AI feedback assistant.

AI Sally is here to help you ask better questions, understand user responses faster, and improve your ideas with less guesswork.

## What AI Sally Does

AI Sally works behind the scenes to highlight patterns in your feedback — so you can focus on what matters most: building the right thing.

> “You don’t need more feedback. You need clarity. That’s where I come in.” – AI Sally

## How AI Sally Helps

- **Rates your ideas** so you get an overall sentiment faster.
- **Gives feedback** to go deeper when something’s unclear.
- **Gives you her take** on whether or not to continue pursuing the idea .
