Before writing a single line of code, answer these three questions:

1. **Who is this for?**  
   Be specific. _“Everyone”_ is not an audience.

2. **What painful problem are you solving?**  
   If it’s not painful, people won’t pay to fix it.

3. **Why now?**  
   Timing matters. Great ideas fail when they’re too early or too late.

Once you can clearly answer these, you’re ready to test your idea.
