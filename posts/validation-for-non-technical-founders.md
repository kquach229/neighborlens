title: How Non-Technical Founders Can Validate Ideas

You donâ€™t need to code to validate.

In fact, some of the best early validation work happens before a single line is written.

## Step 1: Write It Down

Capture your idea, target user, and problem in a paragraph or two.

## Step 2: Submit It to ValidateLens

Youâ€™ll get honest feedback from people whoâ€™ve built or evaluated startups before.

## Step 3: Use That Feedback to Iterate

Tweak your concept. Change your angle. Reposition the product.

Technical execution comes later â€” first, make sure itâ€™s worth building.
