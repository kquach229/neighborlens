title: Prioritizing Simplicity Over Features

Over the past few months, we’ve built fast. Too fast, maybe.

So we’re taking a breath — and simplifying.

ValidateLens doesn’t need to be bloated with every feature under the sun. It needs to be:

- Easy to use
- Clear in purpose
- Focused on **useful validation**

## What We're Doing

- Stripping down the dashboard to only essential actions
- Simplifying the submission flow
- Improving mobile usability
- Cutting experimental features that didn’t add value

This isn’t about doing less — it’s about doing **what matters** more effectively.

Thanks for staying with us as we refine the experience.
